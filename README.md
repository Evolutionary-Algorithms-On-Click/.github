# EvOC - Evolutionary Algorithms On Click

Welcome to the **EvOC (Evolutionary Algorithms On Click)** organization! 

EvOC is a user-friendly framework for designing, executing, and analyzing various evolutionary algorithms (EA, GP, PSO, ML Tuning) through an intuitive graphical interface. Perfect for learners, researchers, and educators ‚Äì no coding required to get started!

## üåü Features

- **Intuitive Configuration**: Visually configure parameters for Genetic Algorithms (GA), Genetic Programming (GP), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and EA for ML Tuning via a simple GUI
- **Powerful Visualizations**: Instantly visualize algorithm progress with fitness plots, understand results with GP trees, or observe swarm behavior with PSO animations
- **Transparent Code Generation**: Generate the underlying Python code (using the DEAP library) based on your GUI setup for transparency, learning, or further customization
- **EA for ML Tuning**: Optimize Machine Learning model features or hyperparameters using Evolutionary Algorithms
- **AI-Powered Explanations**: Integrated AI for clear explanations of generated code and EA concepts
- **Execute, Save & Collaborate**: Run experiments, track execution history, download logs, and easily share configurations and results
